Dr. Xia Feng is a Full Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor in the School of Cyberspace Security at Hainan University. Situated in Hainan Province, a key region for China’s digital economy and international openness, she has developed a research perspective that is highly attuned to diverse regulatory frameworks, data governance models, privacy expectations, and security practices across different countries and regions. As a female scholar, she contributes to the cybersecurity community in both technical and societal dimensions. At the technical level, her work bridges the gap between advanced privacy-preserving cryptographic theory and practical federated learning systems, enabling more efficient, secure, and trustworthy model training in highly dynamic vehicular network environments. In particular, in her work published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, she was the first to integrate batch authentication with secure gradient aggregation to enhance both the efficiency and privacy of federated learning, especially for highly dynamic VANET environments. At the community level, she brings a complementary and often underrepresented viewpoint that enhances community diversity and contributes to more inclusive, user-centric approaches to cybersecurity research and academic governance. In recent years, she has published more than 60 papers in leading journals and conferences such as IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, IEEE TNSE, IEEE TITS, IEEE TCE, IEEE IoTJ, and IEEE TVT (including more than 30 papers on CCF-A/JCR-1/TOP journals, with 1 highly cited paper and 1 best paper award from IEEE conference).

In terms of academic reviewing and editorial service, Dr. Feng has demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility and efficiency. She has served as a reviewer for more than 30 leading journals and conferences, including IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TITS, IEEE TCE, IEEE IoTJ, IEEE TVT, IEEE TNSE, among others. To date, she has reviewed more than 300 manuscripts, consistently delivering high-quality reports without missing deadlines. Notably, her reviewing contributions to IEEE TDSC have been formally recognized with an official reviewer certificate. In addition, building on her academic foundation, she has contributed to editorial service, having served as Associate Editor, or Academic Editor of multiple journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (JCR-1, TOP), Journal on Communications (Chinese T1 journal). Throughout her editorial service, she has managed approximately 80 submissions in a timely, rigorous, and fair manner, including selecting appropriate reviewers, coordinating the peer-review process, and ensuring efficient communication with reviewers and authors. Her research interests include security and privacy protection in different domains such as cloud computing, mobile applications, and Internet of vehicles, applied cryptography, system and network security, which closely aligns with the scope of IEEE TDSC.
