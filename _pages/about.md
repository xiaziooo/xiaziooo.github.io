Dr. Xia Feng is a Professor in the School of Cyberspace Security at Hainan University, where she serves as an Academic Leader and Ph.D. Supervisor. She joined Hainan University in 2024 as a Category-C High-Level Talent of Hainan Province. Dr. Feng received her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Anhui University (2014–2017) and conducted academic research as a Visiting Scholar at the School of Computing, University of Utah, USA (2016–2017).<br>

Dr. Feng specializes in cyber security, vehicular networks, applied cryptography, and adversarial machine learning. Her research has bridged the gap between advanced privacy-preserving cryptographic theory and practical federated learning systems, enabling more efficient, secure, and trustworthy model training in highly dynamic vehicular network environments. By now, she has published more than 60 papers in top-tier journals and conferences, including over 25 works in CCF-A and JCR-Q1 venues, and holds more than 40 invention patents. She has received several notable honors and awards, including provincial and national science and technology awards. She has also led multiple research projects, including Key, General, and Young Scientist Programs of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, as well as provincial R&D and industry-funded projects.<br>
