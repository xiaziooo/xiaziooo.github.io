Dr. Xia Feng is a Full Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor in the Faculty of Data Science at the City University of Macau. Working at the crossroads of Macau’s East-West cultural and academic ecosystem, she has developed a research perspective that is particularly attuned to the diverse regulatory frameworks, privacy expectations, and security practices found across different countries/regions. As a female scholar, she contributes to the cybersecurity community in both technical and societal dimensions. At the technical level, her work bridges the gap between advanced privacy-preserving cryptographic theory and practical federated learning systems, enabling more efficient, secure, and trustworthy model training in highly dynamic vehicular network environments. At the community level, she brings a complementary and often underrepresented viewpoint that enhances community diversity and contributes to more inclusive, user-centric approaches to cybersecurity research and academic governance. Building on this academic foundation, she has also contributed to editorial service, having served as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (2023–2024).  In recent years, she has published more than 60 papers in leading journals and conferences such as IEEE TIFS, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TSC, IEEE TMC, IEEE TNSE, IEEE TITS, IEEE IoTJ, and IEEE TVT, and has been granted over 40 invention patents.

In terms of academic reviewing and editorial service, Dr. Feng has demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility and efficiency. She has served as a reviewer for more than 20 authoritative journals and conferences, including IEEE TIFS, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TMC, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TITS, IEEE TCE, IEEE IoTJ, IEEE TVT, IEEE TNSE, among others. To date, she has reviewed more than 500 manuscripts, consistently delivering high-quality reports without missing deadlines. With respect to editorial work, she has handled around 80 submissions as an Associate Editor, ensuring timely decisions and maintaining a rigorous and efficient editorial process.  Besides, her research interests also align closely with the scope of IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. Her work spans cybersecurity, anonymization and data privacy protection, data encryption, machine learning for information forensics and security, communication/networking and information technology—core areas that directly intersect with the journal’s emphasis on information forensics, trustworthy systems, and security mechanisms in emerging networked environments.
