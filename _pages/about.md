## <span style="font-family: 'Latin Modern', Georgia, serif; font-size: 22px; color: #d85c27;">Profile</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Latin Modern', Georgia, serif"> I am a Professor in the School of Cyberspace Security at Hainan University, where I serve as an Academic Leader and Ph.D. Supervisor. I joined Hainan University in 2024 as a Category-C High-Level Talent of Hainan Province. I have led multiple research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), including a Key Program of the Joint Fund, a General Program, and a Young Scientist Program. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Anhui University (2014–2017) and my M.S. in Computer Science from Jiangsu University (2006–2009). I also studied as a Visiting Scholar in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, USA (2016–2017).
**Openings**: We welcome motivated Master’s and Ph.D. students to collaborate on the following research topics. Please reach out with your CV if you're interested. **Contact (email address)**: xiafeng@hainanu.edu.cn</span>
